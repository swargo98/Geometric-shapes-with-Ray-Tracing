# Geometric shapes with Ray Tracing with appropriate Illumination
 
This project creates a 3D space with multiple geometric objects and a camera that can be moved around. It uses the Phong Lighting Model and Ray Tracing with Recursive Reflection to achieve realistic lighting and reflections.

## Features:
- 3D Geometric Objects: Various shapes are displayed in a 3D space.
- Controllable Camera: The camera can be moved to view the scene from different angles.
- Phong Lighting Model: Simulates how light interacts with surfaces for realistic shading.
- Ray Tracing with Recursive Reflection: Renders reflections accurately for better visual realism.
